# Big file returned from Spring Controller, before WebFlux

I had to develop a REST service for downloading a CSV file.

There were many MongoDB's documents and there was `com.mongodb.DBCursor` for streaming those documents with the usage of `reactor.core.publisher.Flux`. I had an access to the mentioned Flux inside Spring Controller.

Sounds easy, but it was Spring 4, which doesn't support Flux natively.

## Reactive Spring 4

I started with looking for Spring-specific solutions.

To name a few:
* [StreamingResponseBody](https://www.logicbig.com/tutorials/spring-framework/spring-web-mvc/streaming-response-body.html)
   * good idea
   * I was surprised by its package, but it worked pretty well
   * however, I had to build the result file incrementally, waiting for all the documents being streammed. It's not easy with the way `StreamingResponseBody` is constructed. I ended up with `StringBuilder` passed to the class, but I was afraid of putting this to production 
* [ResponseBodyEmitter](https://shazsterblog.blogspot.com/2016/02/asynchronous-streaming-request.html)
   * it's not exactly for streaming
* [RxJava](https://dzone.com/articles/using-rx-java-observable)
   * I didn't want to mix 2 reactive libraries
* [DeferredResult](https://www.nurkiewicz.com/2013/03/deferredresult-asynchronous-processing.html)
   * here I had to wrap the response entity in deffered, not the opposite, so it was a problem

## Async, reactive Java (pure Java)

Everything which can be done with Spring, can be done with pure Java. The worst scenario would be to dig into Spring code and figure out how WebFlux was implemented. I wrote "the worst", because I didn't have much time for my task and the Spring codebase is a huge one.

I found numerous options and hints for reactive Java EE. Some useful materials:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1159168/should-one-call-close-on-httpservletresponse-getoutputstream-getwriter

I ended up with the Spring Controller method with both `HttpServletRequest` and `HttpServletResponse` mixed with an input parameter, serialized directly from the query params.

The crucial part for an asynchronous processing was:
```java
AsyncContext asyncContext = request.startAsync(request, response);
asyncContext.setTimeout(ASYNC_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT);
```

At some point in time I tried to use just `HttpServletRequest` and play with the response got from `AsyncContext`. But the better approach was to use `HttpServletResponse` directly. It was better e.g. for automatically generated `MockedAsyncContext` in tests. I've got a mocked `HttpServletResponse` there thanks to that, not a `null` value.

Final `AsyncContext` processing looked like this (I've changed the names):
```java
HttpServletResponse response = (HttpServletResponse) asyncContext.getResponse();
asyncContext.start(() -> service.getFlux(queryParams)
    .doOnCancel(() -> setErrorResponse(response))
    .doOnError((e) -> setErrorResponse(response))
    .doFinally(signalType -> asyncContext.complete())
    .subscribe(line -> streamToResponse(line, response)));
```

And the main part of `streamToResponse` was:
```java
response.getOutputStream().write(line.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
```

I decided to use `OutputStream`, not the `Writer`. `Writer` itself offers too many methods for writing (`append`, `write`, `print`) and I got confused.

## Last tips

I had to limit the number of `flatMap` operations happening on Flux in parallel, under the hood. I also set a big timeout for `AsyncContext` to ensure that there is the biggest chance for getting the big file back. Otherwise there were problems, e.g. with `OutputStream` being closed before the last document was got.
