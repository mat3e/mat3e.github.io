# Spring Boot Application YAML

I had a Spring Boot application. I started it with Gradle and then... surprise! An error, but no info about its reason.
```java

To figure out what was going on I went with breakpoints on all uncaught exceptions
![Breakpoints on uncaught exceptions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mat3e/mat3e.github.io/master/blog/img/breakpoints_exceptions.png)

and started an app in a debug mode.

When paused in `ReflectionUtils`, `rethrowRuntimeException` method, line 322, I was able to take a look at the error message:
```java
Failed to load property source from location 'classpath:/application-local.yml'
while scanning a simple key
 in 'reader', line 17, column 3:
      h2:g
      ^
could not find expected ':'
 in 'reader', line 18, column 12:
        console:
               ^
```

![Exception in yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mat3e/mat3e.github.io/master/blog/img/yaml_exception.png)

Quick verification and I figured out that I literally had `h2:g` instead of `h2:` inside my _application.yml_ file:
```yaml
h2:g
  console:
    enabled: true
```

I also know that such a problem may apprear in _application.yml_, e.g. when two lines (at the same level) have a different number of whitespace characters.

I don't know why such a meaningful error message was not visible anywhere in the console, when running from Gradle. However, I'm pretty sure it will be fixed soon.
