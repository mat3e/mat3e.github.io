# React, Redux and getting the file

To mix Ajax calls and pure functions (required by Redux pattern) it is usually a good idea to divide a single call into 3 steps:
1. `REQUEST`
2. `SUCCESS`
3. `FAILURE`

In my `SUCCESS` case, I was getting a big file and I wanted to trigger downloading inside the web browser.

I resolved the issue with [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40377541/react-redux-download-file) StackOverflow thread. The key was to use `file-saver` module, e.g. like this, inside the reducer (I've changed the names):
```javascript
import fileSaver from 'file-saver';

[EXPORT.SUCCESS]: (state, { payload, response }) => {
    const filename = /filename="(.+\.csv)"/.exec(response.header['content-disposition'])[1];
    fileSaver.saveAs(new Blob([payload], { type: 'text/csv' }), filename);
    return {
        ...state,
        exporting: false
    };
}
```

As you can see, I had `'Content-disposition'` header inside the response, which had a value like `filename="name.csv"`. I wanted to extract just the `name.csv` from there, so I went with a regular expression with a single group.
